<h1>Work done at Elinta Motors</h1>
<h2>All of my projects and reports for this internship/report are here in this repo</h2>
<p>
    There were 6 tasks given to me to complete, each containing some form of proof with videos.
    The work is done using STM32 microcontrollers.
    For more be sure to open:

<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>The report for the final project (task 5).</h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>The report of my internship (tasks 1-4)</h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>The journal for my internship.</h4>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Task 5 is identical to task 6, only task 6 has extra ADC checking for the circuit for each of the module.

    Since the circuits are not meant for publication, it makes it a lot harder to give a detailed explanation 
    of what the code does for each task, so make sure if you have any questions address it to me.
